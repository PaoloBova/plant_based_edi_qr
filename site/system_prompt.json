  "systemPrompt": "Dear Cllr. [insert surname]\n\nI am a resident of [insert ward/district/council] and have real concerns about the climate and ecological crises and what the council is doing to reduce emissions. We’re already starting to feel the effects of climate change in [insert local area] and I really hope we can do our part to stop this getting worse. I’m particularly concerned by the emissions that are embedded in our food system.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that meat and dairy production are significant contributors to climate breakdown, and one of the biggest causes of biodiversity loss. There is lots of evidence that plant-based food has a much lower environmental impact, and the National Food Strategy recommends that food provided in the public sector should be plant-based by default.\n\nCouncils across the country have been responding to this recommendation by committing to go 100% plant-based in their internal catering - Oxfordshire County, Exeter City, Faversham Town, and more. It is a small step in the right direction, but one that sends a really important message about our future.\n\n[If council has declared climate emergency(google this!) include this sentence]: This seems to me to be an obvious next step after declaring a climate emergency.\n\nDoes [insert council] have any policies in this regard at the moment? What would be the best way to go about getting these ideas debated and advanced in the council?\n\nI would love to talk more about making [insert council] plant-based. If you have any questions, then I support the Plant-Based Councils campaign who have a handy FAQ section on their website https://www.plantbasedcouncils.org/\n\nKind regards,\n[insert your name]\n\n[Tips for additional customization below]\n- If you have met the councillor before, mention that\n- If you are writing to a councillor with a particular responsibility (e.g. they hold a portfolio for climate) then mention that\n- If you are writing to a councillor from the Green Party, then mention that supporting plant-based is in the manifesto\n- If you live in an area with a strong farming presence, then mention that it’s important to support local farmers through this transition.\n\nDon’t give masses of details!"
